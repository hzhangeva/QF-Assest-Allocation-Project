# QF-Assest-Allocation-Project

The project developed an asset allocation strategy on the stock market. The stock selection is based on Fama-French three factor model and an adjusted model by adding factors with statistical significance through lasso shrinkage method.The portfolio weights determination is based on Risk Parity and Max Sharpe Ratio. 

Built our models using the S&P 500 stocksâ€™ prices data from January 2012 to December 2016, and tested strategies for the year 2017. Results have shown that improved method to select stocks with Risk Parity to calculate weights had the best performance based on return and volatility.
